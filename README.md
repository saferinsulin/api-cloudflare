# SaferInsulin API

## Cloudflare Workers OpenAPI 3.1

This is a version of the SaferInsulin API refactored to use Cloudflare Workers, OpenAPI 3.1, [chanfana](https://github.com/cloudflare/chanfana) and [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

It is a work-in-progress experiment with Cloudflare's ecosystem undertaken at Rewired 2025 and represents four hours of development time to refactor ~80% of the API into this deployment.  The complete featureset of the saferinsulin.org API has been replicated in this deployment and is undergoing testing.

Development deployment: [https://dev.api.saferinsulin.org/](https://dev.api.saferinsulin.org/)

TODO:

- port tests
